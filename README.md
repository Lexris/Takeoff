Having the 18-hole scores for a list of golfers, generate the tournament leaderboard.

Each line in the input will contain the name of the golfer (can be one or multiple) and 18 integers.

Example:

Dave Davidson 3 3 3 4 4 3 3 5 4 3 6 5 5 6 6 4 4 5

John 3 2 4 5 4 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 4 4 4 3 4 5

George Jr. 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 4 5 4 6 5 4 5 4 5 6

Print the top 3 golfers with their total scores and their 9-hole totals (sum of the first and the second half of hole scores).

Example:

John 67 (30+37)

Dave Davidson 76 (32+44)

George Jr. 80 (36+44)

The code should be fast, readable and modular.
